This repository contains Tableau dashboard, visualization, and data analysis projects I have created. 


 ## Project Description

 This interactive Tableau dashboard was created to visualize and analyze HR data to derive insights into the employee base. The key goals were to:
 
 - Provide analysis of employee distribution across business units and roles
 - Identify trends in demographics like age, gender, education level
 - Evaluate employee satisfaction and engagement metrics
 - Analyze factors related to employee attrition and turnover
 - Enable data-driven decision making around HR initiatives

The dashboard brings together employee data from various HR systems into a unified view. It allows slicing and dicing the data by departments, demographics, job attributes and other dimensions.

Some key visualizations include:

- Headcount and demographics analysis
- Employee spread by business unit, job function
- Satisfaction scoring trends over time
- Attrition rates by age, gender, job role
- Compensation and performance analysis
- HR KPIs and metrics
